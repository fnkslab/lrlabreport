\section{Overview/研究概要}

\I This section is mandatory
\I Show 1-page\tinyfn{In case of screen view. Otherwise, not applicable} summary of your research 
\I Explain the objective, the core idea/approach, and expected contributions


\section{Recap/前回（まで）のまとめ}

\I This section is mandatory unless this is the first report
\I Show 1-page summary of your previous report(s)


\section{Current report content/今回の報告内容}

\I You can freely organize the remaining part but you should summarize the outline of the report content at first

\I Use \verb|\section| to start a section\tinyfn{You should not try to match each section to 1 page. 
\textbf{This format is not intended to prepare slides. Essentially this is a paper-like document template.} Therefore, when you have a presentation with a material using this template, use the continuous-scroll view (e.g., a web page) rather than the page-by-page view.} as many as you like

\I Use `screen view' when you report in-person, i.e., w/ the `slide' option of \verb|\documentclass|

\I You should write this document in `document view' at first, i.e., w/o the `slide' option


\I Use \verb|\I| for itemizing a description easily like this
%\I If you like, you can also use the \verb|itemize| environment

\I Use \verb|\paper| to cite a paper like \paper{devlin-etal-2019-bert} with its title in a footnote. Otherwise, use \verb|\citep| like \citep{nakaneNLP2025}.

\subsection{Note (this is a subsection)}
{\small \redcolor You can also use normal text descriptions for detailed information. Just like this paragraph you are currently reading. However, such descriptions should be skipped in the oral presentation.}

    \label{tab:type_of_presentations}
\end{table}

\I When you show your results as a table, you must describe the meanings of the results (your interpretation) in text. Do not let the table be alone

\I Before showing the result table, you also need to explain what you did, why you did it, and how you did it.


\section{Plan/今後の計画}

\I List up anything you need to do but put priorities and due dates

\I A Gantt chart is a good way to show yearly schedule
